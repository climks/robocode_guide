# KATS Offsite 2020 -- JSBattle guide

## Introduction
[JSBattle ](https://github.com/jamro/jsbattle) is a programming game where each contestant develops robot tanks to defeat other bots in the battlefield. It is an online JS offshoot of [Robocode](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/), for which people have been enthusiastically building robots since 2000. The top robots in Robocode can be [very sophisticated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qtoh_PjhcU).
