# KATS Offsite 2020 -- Robocode guide

## Introduction
[Robocode](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/) is a programming game where each contestant develops robot tanks to defeat other bots in the battlefield. It began as a personal project in 2000, and people have been enthusiastically building robots ever since. The top robots can be [very sophisticated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qtoh_PjhcU).

## Set up & installation
  1.  Download [robocode-1.9.3.9-setup.jar](https://sourceforge.net/projects/robocode/files/robocode/1.9.3.9/)
  2.  Open Terminal in the downloaded directory
  3.  Run `java -jar robocode-a.b.c.d-setup.jar`

## Writing your first Robot
  1.  On the top bar, go to Robot -> Source Editor
  2.  It may prompt you about which Java compiler to use. Feel free to use your own, but the built-in Eclipse compiler may be the most stable.
  3.  On the top bar, go to File -> New -> Robot
  4.  After making some changes, save the robot, then compile it using Compiler -> Compile.
  
  Congrats! You are now ready to battle with your first bot!
  
  *A more in depth guide can be found [here](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/My_First_Robot).*
  
## Testing/battling your robot against other robots
  1. Exit the source editor, and go to Battle -> New.
  2. You should see your package/bot in the list to the left or the middle. Add your bot, and add any other bots you want to beat down.
  3. Start Battle!
  
## Suggestions & helpful links
  * You have access to all the source code for the sample bots. Feel free to improve upon them, and mix and match their strengths
  * List of moves a robot can make can be found [here](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/docs/robocode/).
  * The [Robocode Wiki](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Main_Page) is full of interesting information, from guides to fast trig libraries to entire source codes for top-level bots.
